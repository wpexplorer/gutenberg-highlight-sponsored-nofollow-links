# Gutenberg Highlight Sponsored & Nofollow Links
A little plugin based on our tutorial [Highlight Sponsored & Nofollow Links in Gutenberg](https://www.wpexplorer.com/how-to-disable-wordpress-gutenberg-block-patterns/](https://www.wpexplorer.com/highlight-sponsored-nofollow-links-gutenberg/)

The plugin will remove all the core and remove patterns.

## How to Install the Plugin?
Head over to [releases](https://github.com/wpexplorer/gutenberg-highlight-sponsored-nofollow-links/releases) download the latest version. Once the zip has downloaded it will have the format gutenberg-highlight-sponsored-nofollow-links-{version}. You can upload this zip file, but we recommend you instead unzip the folder, rename it to just "gutenberg-highlight-sponsored-nofollow-links", re-zip then upload it to your site.
